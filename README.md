# Project_Based_Learning_React

Welcome to the **Project Based Learning in React** repository! This repository contains various projects that I have built during my learning process of React. Each project aims to help understand and apply different React concepts and techniques. The projects also incorporate TailwindCSS for styling.

These projects demonstrates how to handle API requests, manage state, contexts, display data dynamically, and use of `react-router-dom` for navigation in a React application.

## Technologies Used
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TailwindCSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **react-router-dom**: A standard library for routing in React.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Project_based_learning_react.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
    ```bash
    cd Project_based_learning_react
    ```
3. Install dependencies for the specific project:

    ```
4. Start the development server:
